# Project: Population genomic analysis of Smallmouth Bass and Neosho Bass in the Central Interior Highlands
We investigated the extent of genomic divergence, local directional selection, and admixture between the Smallmouth Bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) and the Neosho Bass (<i>M. velox</i>) in the Central Interior Highlands (CIH) ecoregion of central north America. Specifically, we used ddRADseq data to assessed the phylogenomic relationship between and within species, characterizing inter- and intraspecific diversity and SNPs potentially under local directional selection at the population level. Additionally, we inferred the relative timing of admxiture in Neosho Bass streams where there is known introgressive hybridization with Smallmouth Bass to understand the influence of natural, historic geographic factors on mixing (stream capture or transient flooding) vs. anthropogenic factors (i.e., non-native introductions through stocking), which is known to have occurred widely in these economically valuable species. We ultimately hoped to provide novel insights into the diversity of endemic, ecologically important and popular sport fish in the CIH.

## Specific Aim: Population Inference
In this analysis, we used the finerad.vcf data generated in Analysis 2 (SNP Filtering...) to assess fine-scale coancestry between Smallmouth Bass, and Neosho Bass in the CIH using haplotype inference (excluding Spotted Bass). Specifically, we estimated coancestry in 1) the full dataset, with all pure and admixed individuals, excluding the Spotted Bass X Smallmouth Bass hybrid (BFC10) inferred from population genomic analysis in Analysis 3, 2) the pure dataset, with only pure individuals of Smallmouth Bass and Neosho Bass, and 3) the admixed dataset, with only admixed individuals of Neosho Bass (no admixed Smallmouth Bass were detected).

## Phases of analysis:
### Phase 1: Data preparation 
### Phase 2: Coancestry analysis
### Phase 3: Plotting

## Libraries needed for analysis
```{r libraries, echo = FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(devtools)
library(SNPRelate)
library(vcfR)
library(XML)
library(RColorBrewer)
source("../fineradstructure_analysis/FinestructureLibrary.R") #Fine-structure R source code
```

## PHASE 1: DATA PREPARATION
In this phase of the analysis, we are reading in the fully filtered, non-thinned VCF dataset (`finerad.vcf`) and generating haplotype mapping files (hapmap) files to be used for coancestry analysis with the software program FINERADSTRUCTURE. We are interested in delimiting populations of tight coancestry within the Smallmouth Bass and Neosho Bass, so we exclude Spotted Bass from the dataset before preceding with coancestry analyses for 1) all Smallmouth Bass and Neosho Bass samples; 2) pure samples only, and 3) admixed samples only.

All analyses conducted by calling commands in bash shell scripts were performed on the Lewis high-performance computing cluster at the University of Missouri <br>

### STEP 1: Generate a general bash shell script header for all FINERADSTRUCTURE commands
In this step, we are generating a universal bash shell script to run all input file conversions and subsequent coancestry analyses in FINERADSTRUCTURE. Here, we only generate the annotated header for the shell script, and in subsequent steps, we include and provide details on each file conversion or analysis and the associated lines of code in Rmd chunks. The shell script for running all FINERADSTRUCTURE code is called "finerad.sh".

##### 1a: Generate the header for a general bash shell script to run FINERADSTRUCTURE:

##### Generate FINERADSTRUCTURE bash shell script: `code/shell_scripts/finerad.sh`
