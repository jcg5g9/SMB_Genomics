# Project: Population genomic analysis of Smallmouth Bass and Neosho Bass in the Central Interior Highlands
We investigated the extent of genomic divergence, local directional selection, and admixture between the Smallmouth Bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) and the Neosho Bass (<i>M. velox</i>) in the Central Interior Highlands (CIH) ecoregion of central north America. Specifically, we used ddRADseq data to assessed the phylogenomic relationship between and within species, characterizing inter- and intraspecific diversity and SNPs potentially under local directional selection at the population level. Additionally, we inferred the relative timing of admxiture in Neosho Bass streams where there is known introgressive hybridization with Smallmouth Bass to understand the influence of natural, historic geographic factors on mixing (stream capture or transient flooding) vs. anthropogenic factors (i.e., non-native introductions through stocking), which is known to have occurred widely in these economically valuable species. We ultimately hoped to provide novel insights into the diversity of endemic, ecologically important and popular sport fish in the CIH.

## Specific Aim: Directional selection analysis
In this analysis, we used the popgen.vcf data generated in Analysis 2 (SNP Filtering...) to scan for signatures of directional selection on SNP loci with outlier Fst (high outlier Fst: directional selection; low Fst: balancing selection). We used two software programs with different underlying statistical frameworks to detect outliers and then used any outliers commonly detected in both analyses as canditates for being under strong selection. Specifically, we used the software program BAYESCAN (based in Bayesian analysis) and the R package PCAdapt principal component analysis (based in multivariate principal component analysis). We then employed DAPC in R to map patterns of population differentiation at any shared outlier and neutral loci to detect populations that may be under differential selection pressures and to detect signatures of genetic drift, respectively.

## Phases of analysis:
### Phase 1: Data preparation
### Phase 2: Outlier Fst analysis with BAYESCAN
### Phase 3: Outlier Fst analysis with PCADAPT
### Phase 4: Outlier mapping

## Libraries needed for analysis
```{r setup, echo = FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(devtools)
library(SNPRelate)
library(vcfR)
library(pophelper)
library(PopGenome)
library(pcadapt)
library(viridis)
```

## PHASE 1: DATA PREPARATION
In this phase of the analysis, we are converting the fully filtered, thinned dataset excluding Spotted Bass and the Spotted Bass hybrid (`admixture_phylogenomics_analysis/data/processed_vcf/03_popgen_spb.vcf`) into input files compatible with the software programs BAYESCAN and the R package PCAdapt. For BAYESCAN, we are using the intermediate conversion software PGDSPIDER to generate input files, and for PCAdapt, we are again using the program PLINK.

For the outlier Fst analysis, we are conducing scans for outlier loci hiearchically at the black bass species level (between Spotted Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Neosho Bass), among species within the Smallmouth Bass species complex (Smallmouth Bass and Neosho Bass), and among populations within black bass species. The goal with this structure is to reduce false positive detection due to population structure and to detect potentially selected SNPs at each hierarchical level.

With this analysis structure, we conducted scans with the following sets of data: 

1) All black bass samples, including Spotted Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Neosho Bass (excluding the Spotted Bass hybrid)
2) All Smallmouth Bass and Neosho Bass samples, excluding Spotted Bass
3) All Neosho Bass populations only
4) All Smallmouth Bass populations only

All analyses conducted by calling commands in bash shell scripts were performed on the Lewis high-performance computing cluster at the University of Missouri <br>

### STEP 1: Prepare input data for BAYESCAN.
In this step, we are using the conversion software PGDSPIDER to prepare all input data for the software program BAYESCAN.

#### 1a: Filter fully filtered, thinned VCF file (excluding Spotted Bass hybrid) for each analysis level 
In this step, we are generating filtered VCF data to to run each level of the outlier Fst analysis (see above for the four hierarchical levels of analysis)  

##### 1a.1. Generate a general bash shell script header for all VCF filtering steps commands
In this step, we are generating a universal bash shell script to run all filtering commands in VCFTOOLS (See Phase 1 in Analysis 2 for programs needed and citation information) Here, we only generate the annotated header for the shell script, and in subsequent steps, we include and provide details on each file conversion and the associated lines of code in Rmd chunks. The shell script for running all VCFTOOLS code is called "vcftools.sh".

###### 1a.1.1 Copy and paste the code below in a new shell script file:

##### Generate VCFTOOLS bash shell script: `code/shell_scripts/vcftools.sh`
```{bash}
#! /bin/bash

#SBATCH -p Lewis  # use the Lewis partition
#SBATCH -J filter_admixed  # give the job a custom name
#SBATCH -o filtering_missing.out  # give the job output a custom name
#SBATCH -t 0-02:00  # two hour time limit

#SBATCH -N 1  # number of nodes
#SBATCH -n 1  # number of cores (AKA tasks)

## UNCOMMENT LINES STARTING HERE 

## Load VCFtools module
# module load rss/rss-2020
# module load vcftools/vcftools-v0.1.14
```

##### 1a.2. Generate lists of individuals to use for all filtering steps.
In this step, we are generating lists of individuals to filter from the VCF dataset. For the first level of analysis (all black bass samples, we are not excluding any samples). For the second level of analysis, we are excluding Spotted Bass. For the third level of analysis, we are excluding all Smallmouth Bass to retain only Neosho Bass. For the fourth analysis, we are excluding all Neosho Bass to retain only Smallmouth Bass.

###### 1a.2.1. Generate a list of Spotted Bass to omit from analyses 2, 3, and 4.

##### Generate list file: `data/filtering_data/spotted_bass.txt`
```{r}
# Load in full metadata
load("../raw_data/metadata.Rda")

# Filter all individuals but Spotted Bass
spotted_bass <- metadata %>%
  filter(species == "Spotted_Bass")

# Convert to dataframe
spotted_bass <- data.frame(spotted_bass) %>%
  select(sample_id)

# Save the list of bad samples as a .txt file without column names
write_tsv(spotted_bass, 
          file = "data/filtering_data/spotted_bass.txt", 
          col_names = FALSE)

# Turn column into vector without column name to save as un-headered list for downstream filtering
spotted_bass <- as.vector(spotted_bass$sample_id)

# Save the list of bad samples as a .Rda file without column names
save(spotted_bass, file = "data/filtering_data/spotted_bass.Rda")
```

###### 1a.2.2. Generate a list of Smallmouth Bass to omit from analysis 3.

smallmouth_bass <- data.frame(smallmouth_bass) %>%
  select(sample_id)

# Save the list of bad samples as a .txt file without column names
write_tsv(smallmouth_bass, 
          file = "data/filtering_data/smallmouth_bass.txt", 
          col_names = FALSE)

# Turn column into vector without column name to save as un-headered list for downstream filtering
smallmouth_bass <- as.vector(smallmouth_bass$sample_id)

# Save the list of bad samples as a .Rda file without column names
save(smallmouth_bass, file = "data/filtering_data/smallmouth_bass.Rda")
```

###### 1a.2.3. Generate a list of Neosho Bass to omit from analysis 4.

##### Generate list file: `data/filtering_data/neosho_bass.txt`
```{r}
# Filter all individuals but Spotted Bass
neosho_bass <- metadata %>%
  filter(species == "Neosho_Bass")

# Convert to dataframe
neosho_bass <- data.frame(neosho_bass) %>%
  select(sample_id)

# Save the list of bad samples as a .txt file without column names
write_tsv(neosho_bass, 
          file = "data/filtering_data/neosho_bass.txt", 
          col_names = FALSE)

# Turn column into vector without column name to save as un-headered list for downstream filtering
neosho_bass <- as.vector(neosho_bass$sample_id)

# Save the list of bad samples as a .Rda file without column names
save(neosho_bass, file = "data/filtering_data/neosho_bass.Rda")
```

#### 1c: Generate population designation files (read by SPID files)
In this step, we are generating text files listing all samples in at each genome scan level and their corresponding population designations as inferred in Analysis 4 (population inference). Our inferred populations were named according to their general geographic locations (see Phase 4 of population_analysis, "MIDARK", "ELK", "BAYOU", etc.), but PGDSPIDER expects input populations in a specific format (i.e., "pop_1", "pop_2", etc.). We generate population files according to this naming convention

### ----------------------- END OF PHASE 1: DATA PREPARATION ----------------------- ###

## PHASE 2: OUTLIER ANALYSIS WITH BAYESCAN
In this phase of the analysis, we are using the software program BAYESCAN to conduct a genome scan for SNP loci with outlier Fst values to assess potential signatures of local directional selection and neutrality at various loci. We are conducting this analysis at four hierarchical levels, as listed in the description for Phase 1 of the analysis (see above). We are using input data for each hierarchical level of analysis as generated in Phase 1 of this analysis.

BAYESCAN uses a Bayesian framework to calculate probabilities of outlier loci across the genome.

All analyses conducted by calling commands in bash shell scripts were performed on the Lewis high-performance computing cluster at the University of Missouri <br>

### STEP 1: Generate a general bash shell script header for all BAYESCAN runs.
In this step, we are generating a universal bash shell script to run all analyses in BAYESCAN Here, we only generate the annotated header for the shell script, and in subsequent steps, we include and provide details on each analysis and the associated lines of code in Rmd chunks. The shell script for running all BAYESCAN code is called "bayescan.sh".

### STEP 2: Identify SNP loci associated with outlier Fst inferred in BAYESCAN.
In this step, we are reading in the Fst results generated in the BAYESCAN analysis in Phase 2 Step 1 and identifying loci with outlier Fst values.

#### 2a: Read in Fst results for all hiearchical analyses; run the Rmd chunk below.

##### Read in Fst results for all analyses:
```{r}
# Read in data for all black bass samples (Spotted Bass, Neosho Bass, and Smallmouth Bass)
all_fst <- read.table("data/bayescan_output/01_all_output/01_all_fst.txt")

# Convert to dataframe
all_fst <- as.data.frame(all_fst)

# Modify column names
colnames(all_fst) <- c("probability", "log_po", "q", "alpha", "fst")


# Read in data for species complex samples (Neosho Bass and Smallmouth Bass)
species_complex_fst <- read.table("data/bayescan_output/02_species_complex_output/02_species_complex_fst.txt")

# Convert to dataframe
species_complex_fst <- as.data.frame(species_complex_fst)
  
# Modify column names
colnames(species_complex_fst) <- c("probability", "log_po", "q", "alpha", "fst")


# Read in data for Neosho Bass
neosho_fst <- read.table("data/bayescan_output/03_neosho_output/03_neosho_fst.txt")

# Convert to dataframe
neosho_fst <- as.data.frame(neosho_fst)

# Modify column names
colnames(neosho_fst) <- c("probability", "log_po", "q", "alpha", "fst")
  

# Read in data for Smallmouth Bass
smallmouth_fst <- read.table("data/bayescan_output/04_smallmouth_output/04_smallmouth_fst.txt")

# Convert to dataframe
smallmouth_fst <- as.data.frame(smallmouth_fst)

# Modify column names
colnames(smallmouth_fst) <- c("probability", "log_po", "q", "alpha", "fst")
```

#### 2b: Identify outlier SNP loci
In this step, we are identifying SNP loci with high probability of being under selection based on log10 of the posterior odds (log_po), which is given in column 2 of the BAYESCAN output data. Per the BAYESCAN user manual, any SNP with log10 posterior odds greater than or equal to 0.5 is deemed "substantially likely to be under selection". We therefore isolated all SNPs with log_po greater than 0.5 and designated them as "significant". All SNPs with log_po less than 0.5 were designated as "not significant".

We provided information on the level of significance for each "significant" SNP per to the BAYESCAN user manual (retrieved from: http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/BayeScan/files/BayeScan2.0_manual.pdf):

<b>BAYESCAN levels of significance</b>: <br>
2.00 <= log_po < infinity: decisive <br>
1.50 <= log_po < 2.00: very strong <br>
1.00 <= log_po < 1.50: strong <br>
0.50 <= log_po < 1.00: substantial <br>
0.00 <= log_po < 0.50: barely worth mentioning <br>

##### 2b.1.  Generate metadata for SNP ID (RAD_kmer_...) and SNP position (nucleotide position on the kmer)
In this step, we are generating a list of SNP IDs and positions to append to the datasets below in order to determine the identity of outlier SNPs

###### 2b.1.1.Generate SNP position and metadata; run the Rmd chunk below:

##### Generate list of SNP ID and position:
```{r}
# Read in .bim file, which contains a list of RAD kmer names and associated positions
metadata_snps <- read_tsv("data/processed_bed/01_all_output/01_all.bim", col_names = F)
  
# Keep only SNP name and position columns
metadata_snps <- metadata_snps[,c(1,4)]

# Rename columns
colnames(metadata_snps) <- c("snp_id", "position")
```

##### 2b.2. Isolate significant and insignificant SNPs for all black bass samples; run the Rmd chunk below:

### STEP 3: Plot BAYESCAN Fst results
In this step, we are using the Fst data inferred from BAYESCAN to plot Fst as a function of log posterior odds, which shows the distribution of Fst values and their respective signficance.

#### 3a: Generate plots for each hierarchical analysis; run the Rmd chunk below:
We chose to include each plot as separate panels in one figure. The plots are named "a", "b", "c", and "d", and appear in that order in the final manuscript. We colored points and included dotted lines to indicate significance level.

### ----------------------- END OF PHASE 2: OUTLIER ANALYSIS WITH BAYESCAN ----------------------- ###

## PHASE 3: OUTLIER ANALYSIS WITH PCADAPT
In this phase of the analysis, we are using the R package PCADAPT to conduct a genome scan for SNP loci with outlier Fst values to assess potential signatures of local directional selection and neutrality at various loci. We are conducting this analysis at four hierarchical levels, as listed in the description for Phase 1 of the analysis (see above). We are using input data for each hierarchical level of analysis as generated in Phase 1 of this analysis.

PCADAPT uses a multivariate framework (Principal Component Analysis; PCA) to account for population structure among populations and determine likely outlier SNPs driving differentiation between populations.

### STEP 1: Read in input data for PCADAPT, which are the .bed format files generated in Phase 1 above, and prepare sample metadata

#### 1a: Read in .bed files for all hierarchical analyses; run the Rmd chunk below:

###### Read in input data:
```{r, include=FALSE}
# Read in data for all black bass samples
all_bed <- read.pcadapt("data/processed_bed/01_all_output/01_all.bed", type = "bed") 

# Read in data for species complex samples
species_complex_bed <- read.pcadapt("data/processed_bed/02_species_complex_output/02_species_complex.bed", type = "bed") 

# Read in data for Neosho Bass samples
neosho_bed <- read.pcadapt("data/processed_bed/03_neosho_output/03_neosho.bed", type = "bed")

# Read in data for Smallmouth Bass samples
smallmouth_bed <- read.pcadapt("data/processed_bed/04_smallmouth_output/04_smallmouth.bed", type = "bed") 
```

#### 1b: Filter sample metadata to include only individuals and their corresponding populations in each hierarchical analysis. Population IDs will be used for later plotting; run the Rmd chunk below:

##### Generate sample metadata for plotting:
```{r}
# Load in raw metadata
load("../population_analysis/data/metadata/metadata_populations_spb.Rda")

# Generate metadata for all black bass samples
all_metadata <- metadata_populations_spb %>%
  filter(sample_id != "BFC10_1")

# Generate metadata for species complex samples
species_complex_metadata <- metadata_populations_spb %>%
  filter(sample_id != "BFC10_1") %>%
  filter(population != "SPB")

# Generate metadata for Neosho Bass samples
neosho_metadata <- metadata_populations_spb %>%
  filter(sample_id != "BFC10_1") %>%
  filter(population != "SPB") %>%
  filter(population != "MISS") %>%
  filter(population != "WHITE") %>%
  filter(population != "SKIA")

# Generate metadata for Smallmouth Bass samples
smallmouth_metadata <- metadata_populations_spb %>%
  filter(sample_id != "BFC10_1") %>%
  filter(population != "SPB") %>%
  filter(population != "MIDARK") %>%
  filter(population != "LMULB") %>%
  filter(population != "ELK") %>%
  filter(population != "ILLI") %>%
  filter(population != "BAYOU") %>%
  filter(population != "UPPARK")

# Convert population lists for each metadata file into vectors

# Make vector for all black bass populations
all_pops <- as.vector(all_metadata[,c(2)])

# Make vector for species complex populations
species_complex_pops <- as.vector(species_complex_metadata[,c(2)])

# Make vector for Neosho Bass populations
neosho_pops <- as.vector(neosho_metadata[,c(2)])

# Make vector for Smallmouth Bass populations
smallmouth_pops <- as.vector(smallmouth_metadata[,c(2)])
```

### STEP 2: Run PCADAPT Analysis on all hierarchical levels. 

#### 2a: Run PCAdapt analysis for a possible K = 1-20 and with a minimum allele frequency threshold of 0.0001. 
PCADAPT explicitly accounts for population structure in the data by testing different possible numbers of K clusters (similar in principle to the program ADMIXTURE). The minor allele frequency threshold is just a placeholder here for the the analysis to run

##### 2a.1. Run PCAdapt analysis; run the Rmd chunk below:

##### Run PCA through PCAdapt to identify outlier SNPs:
```{r}
#Run PCAdapt for all black bass samples 
all_pca_k20 <- pcadapt(all_bed, K = 20, min.maf = 0.0001) 

#Run PCAdapt for species complex samples 
species_complex_pca_k20 <- pcadapt(species_complex_bed, K = 20, min.maf = 0.0001)

#Run PCAdapt for Neosho Bass samples 
neosho_pca_k20 <- pcadapt(neosho_bed, K = 20, min.maf = 0.0001)

#Run PCAdapt for Smallmouth Bass samples 
smallmouth_pca_k20 <- pcadapt(smallmouth_bed, K = 20, min.maf = 0.0001)
```

##### 2a.2. Choose the optimal number of K PCAs to retain in downstream analyses by assessing Scree plots; run the Rmd chunk below:

##### Visualize Scree plots:
```{r}
#Scree plot for all black bass samples 
all_scree <- plot(all_pca_k20, option = "screeplot") 

#Scree plot for species complex samples 
species_complex_scree <- plot(species_complex_pca_k20, option = "screeplot") 

#Scree plot for Neosho Bass samples 
neosho_scree <- plot(neosho_pca_k20, option = "screeplot") 

#Scree plot for Smallmouth Bass samples 
smallmouth_scree <- plot(smallmouth_pca_k20, option = "screeplot") 
```
Here, we used Catell's Rule to determine the optimal number of clusters to retain in PC analysis. Thus, we chose the number of K PCs to retain based on where the Scree plot line began to plateau. We then reran PCADAPT analysis on the optimal number of K to determine the amount of variance explained by that number of PCs in downstream analyses.

##### 2a.3. Extract Scree plot variance explained information and generate figures.
In tis step, we are extracting information on the variance explained by each Principal Component in the PCAs calculated with K = 20 above and plotting these data.

###### 2a.3.1. Summarize variance information from each hierarchical analysis; run the Rmd chunk below:

##### Generate Scree plot figures for publication:
```{r}
## Generate variance data for all black bass samples at K = 20

   mutate(K = as.numeric(K))


## Generate variance data for Smallmouth Bass samples at K = 20

smallmouth_pca_variance_k20 <- data.frame(root_variance = as.numeric(smallmouth_pca_k20$singular.values))

# Calculate variance 
smallmouth_pca_variance_k20 <- smallmouth_pca_variance_k20 %>%
   mutate(variance = (root_variance)^2)

# Convert rownames to column
smallmouth_pca_variance_k20 <- rownames_to_column(smallmouth_pca_variance_k20, "K")

# Convert K to numeric vector
smallmouth_pca_variance_k20 <- smallmouth_pca_variance_k20 %>% 
   mutate(K = as.numeric(K))

## Summarize information on total variance explained by 20 PCs for each dataset
sum(all_pca_variance_k20$variance) #96.19% 
sum(species_complex_pca_variance_k20$variance) #59.80% 
sum(neosho_pca_variance_k20$variance) #53.52% 
sum(smallmouth_pca_variance_k20$variance) #100.00% 
```

###### 2a.3.2. Generate variance explained figures; run the Rmd chunk below:
Here, we have chosen to include all individual Scree plots as panels in a single plot. Panels are labeled "a", "b", "c", and "d", and are presented in the figure in that order.

##### Generate Scree plot figure: `figures/pcadapt_figures/variance.pdf`

### STEP 3: Identify outlier SNP loci.
In this step, we are identifying SNPs explaining the largest proportion of variance on each retained PC to determine SNPs potentially under selection.

#### 3a: 

## Get outlier SNPs using bonferroni p-value corrections
```{r}
all_p_vals_pca <- all_pca_K2$pvalues

#IMPORTANT NOTE: 4 SNPs were dropped here, because after removal of BFC10, 4 SNPs appear to be fixed for one allele (homozygous for a single SNP). 

#Adjust and clean p-values
all_p_vals_bonf <- p.adjust(all_p_vals_pca, method = "bonferroni") #adjust p-values for multiple test with bonferroni correction
all_p_vals_bonf <- as.data.frame(all_p_vals_bonf) #create dataframe from bonferroni corrected p-values
all_p_vals_bonf <- cbind(snp_ids_with_pos, all_p_vals_bonf) #append snp ids dataset to corrected p-values
all_p_vals_bonf <- all_p_vals_bonf[,c(1,3)]
colnames(all_p_vals_bonf) <- c("snp_id","p_val") #clean dataframe to include appropriate column lables
all_p_vals_bonf <- all_p_vals_bonf %>%
   drop_na() #50,824 SNPs left after removing fixed alleles

#Retrieve significant outlier snps
all_pcadapt_snps_significant <- all_p_vals_bonf %>% 
   filter(p_val < 0.05) #extract only snps with p-values less than 0.05

all_pcadapt_snps_not_significant <- all_p_vals_bonf %>% 
   filter(p_val >= 0.05) #extract only snps with p-values greater than or equal to 0.05

#Get the number of significant and non-significant SNPs from PCADAPT
dim(all_pcadapt_snps_significant) #16,358 SNPs
dim(all_pcadapt_snps_not_significant) #34,466 SNPs

all_bayescan_pcadapt_outlier_merged <- merge(all_pcadapt_snps_significant, bayescan_all_fst_significant, by = "snp_id")
all_bayescan_pcadapt_neutral_merged <- merge(all_pcadapt_snps_not_significant, bayescan_all_fst_not_significant, by = "snp_id")

#There are no shared outlier SNPs between datasets, so they will not be analyed further
#There are 34,463 neutral SNPs
```

## Outlier SNPs - SMB Samples Only

## Get outlier SNPs using bonferroni p-value corrections
```{r}
#Get outlier SNPs using various p-value corrections
smb_p_vals_pca <- smb_pca_K2$pvalues #extract p-values for each snp
smb_p_dropped <- as.data.frame(smb_p_vals_pca) %>% filter(is.na(smb_p_vals_pca)) # 7,951 dropped

###IMPORTANT NOTE: At this point, 7,951 SNPs were dropped from the analysis (and do not have p-values; NAs), because they are not true SNPs. They are fixed SNPs for all Smallmouth Bass samples. In other words, all 87 SMB individuals are homozygous for a single allele in this case.

###I thought that, at this point, it may be necessary to re-run my original, hierarchical datasets for SMB only, Neosho SMB only, and Northern SMB only, because minor allele frequency will change when any number of samples are dropped from a dataset. This will affect the number of SNPs that are filtered when different filter thresholds are set (for missing data, heterozygosity, minor allele frequency, etc.). However, I argue that this is NOT necessary, because my original filters were applied to the whole dataset, which is the dataset that was used to call SNPs in the first place. Minor allele frequency thresholds are typically used to filter out samples that have low minor allele frequencies due to sequencing error. Sequencing error should be evaluated at the level of the entire dataset (i.e. including every single sample). If samples are then removed from the dataset post-hoc, that will affect allele frequencies because the total number alleles in the dataset will change. But it will not affect the minor allele frequency due to sequencing errors. After post-hoc sample filtering, we should expect that minor allele frequencies below the originally established threshold are due to differences between the samples and potentially representative of biological differences.

#Adjust and clean p-values
smb_p_vals_bonf <- p.adjust(smb_p_vals_pca, method = "bonferroni") #adjust p-values for multiple test with bonferroni correction
smb_p_vals_bonf <- as.data.frame(smb_p_vals_bonf) #create dataframe from bonferroni corrected p-values
smb_p_vals_bonf <- cbind(snp_ids_with_pos, smb_p_vals_bonf) #append snp ids dataset to corrected p-values
smb_p_vals_bonf <- smb_p_vals_bonf[,c(1,3)]
colnames(smb_p_vals_bonf) <- c("snp_id","p_val") #clean dataframe to include appropriate column lables
smb_p_vals_bonf <- smb_p_vals_bonf %>%
   drop_na() #42,877 SNPs left after removing fixed alleles

#Retrieve significant outlier snps
smb_pcadapt_snps_significant <- smb_p_vals_bonf %>% 
   filter(p_val < 0.05) #extract only snps with p-values less than 0.05

smb_pcadapt_snps_not_significant <- smb_p_vals_bonf %>% 
   filter(p_val >= 0.05) #extract only snps with p-values greater than or equal to 0.05

#Get the number of significant and non-significant SNPs from PCADAPT
dim(smb_pcadapt_snps_significant) #1006 SNPs
dim(smb_pcadapt_snps_not_significant) #41,871 SNPs
```

## MERGE DATASETS
## Merge datasets for outlier SNPs and neutral SNPs for BAYESCAN and PCADAPT
```{r}
#Merge datasets for outlier SNPs and neutral SNPs for BAYESCAN and PCADAPT
smb_bayescan_pcadapt_outlier_merged <- merge(smb_pcadapt_snps_significant, bayescan_smb_lineages_fst_significant, by = "snp_id")
smb_bayescan_pcadapt_neutral_merged <- merge(smb_pcadapt_snps_not_significant, bayescan_smb_lineages_fst_not_significant, by = "snp_id")

#########This is where PCAdapt and Bayescan overlap#############

# 156 SNPs (signficant in both pcadapt analysis and bayescan)
# 41,324 SNPs (non-significant in both pcadapt analysis and bayescan)
```

###The Merge Datasets section combines the tabular output of both Bayescan and PCAdapt to identify individual SNPs that are signicant outliers in both types of analyses. SNPs that are identified as outliers in both types of analysis are considered to have stronger support as actual outliers. There are no separate subsections for this section.

#IMPORTANT NOTE: both of these tables need to be further edited in excel so that they are compatible with vcftools for later editing. The first column (column identifiers) needs to be omitted, and the RAD_kmer_ tag on each SNP needs to be removed. Also, column headers need to be removed.

### ----------------------- END OF PHASE 3: OUTLIER ANALYSIS WITH PCADAPT ----------------------- ###

## PHASE 4: OUTLIER MAPPING
In this phase of the analysis, we are conducting a multivariate analysis on SNPs either inferred to be significant outliers or neutral in both the BAYESCAN and PCADAPT genome scan analyses. Specifically, we are mapping <i>a priori</i> populations (determined in Analysis 4 (population inference)) onto multivariate space using outlier and neutral SNPs as response variables in Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC).
