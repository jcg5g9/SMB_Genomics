# Project: Population genomic analysis of Smallmouth Bass and Neosho Bass in the Central Interior Highlands
We investigated the extent of genomic divergence, local directional selection, and admixture between the Smallmouth Bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) and the Neosho Bass (<i>M. velox</i>) in the Central Interior Highlands (CIH) ecoregion of central north America. Specifically, we used ddRADseq data to assessed the phylogenomic relationship between and within species, characterizing inter- and intraspecific diversity and SNPs potentially under local directional selection at the population level. Additionally, we inferred the relative timing of admxiture in Neosho Bass streams where there is known introgressive hybridization with Smallmouth Bass to understand the influence of natural, historic geographic factors on mixing (stream capture or transient flooding) vs. anthropogenic factors (i.e., non-native introductions through stocking), which is known to have occurred widely in these economically valuable species. We ultimately hoped to provide novel insights into the diversity of endemic, ecologically important and popular sport fish in the CIH.
